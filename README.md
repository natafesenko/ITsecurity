  **Security triad (also called the AIC or CIA)** The security triad mandates protection against the loss of confidentiality, the loss of integrity, and the loss of availability of IT systems and data. Other principles include defense-in-depth and the principle of least privilege

  Step you take to reduce weaknesses reduces your risks:

  * Enforce the principle of least privilege.
  * Implement strong authentication mechanisms.
  * Train employees on risks of social engineering.
  * Regularly remind employees about their security responsibilities.
  * Implement multiple layers of security (defense-in-depth).
  * Remove or disable unneeded services and protocols.
  * Implement host-based and network-based firewalls.
  * Keep all systems up to date with patches.
  * Install and update antivirus software.
  * Add redundancies for critical systems.
  * Secure access to data with permissions.
  * Back up data and store a backup copy off-site.
  * Track access to data and systems with audit trails.
  * Encrypt critical data at rest and when transmitted on the wire.
  * Protect systems, data, and facilities with strong physical security.
